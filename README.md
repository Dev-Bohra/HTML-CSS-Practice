### Simple Personal Website
Starter code was provided by Scrimba.
Deploy at Netlify or any other service provider just to get the hang of it.

### Simple Newsletter Subscription (From Scratch)
The styling was inspired by the Daily Dribble Project in which the learners had to create the webpage from scratch using the Design Template provided.

### Business Card
Started Code & Follow Along provided by Scrimba. Ideal to play with the color palette. Check out the colour palette generator given in the resources section.

### Bookstore Page (From Scratch)
This was supposed to be a solo project, I was inspired by the UI for goodreads and decided to try to emulate it with albeit slightly different colours.
Also Utilized the hover pseudoclass in CSS to change the visuals of the 'Purchase' Button.

### Esports Recruitment Site (From Scratch)
This project was inspired by the solo challenge to build a simple web agency website with a contact us button. I decided to innovate it and redirect the user to fill a form with all their details.
